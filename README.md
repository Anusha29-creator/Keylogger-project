Project overview
Keyloggers are a type of computer malware that records keystroke events on the keyboard and saves them to a log file, allowing it to steal sensitive data like passwords. Malicious software captures usernames, PINs, and passwords as a result. Without drawing the user's attention, the hacker Keyloggers possess a big threat to both Transactions such as commercial and personal i.e., E-commerce, online banking, email chatting, and other similar activities are examples of online activities.An attacker can collect valuable data without entering into a strong database or file server using this method.
The cause of our project is to expand an effective option to mitigate the dangers associated with keyloggers, which pose a great threat to private and organizational protection.
Our objectives consist of know-how the internal workings of keyloggers, designing and implementing a sturdy protection mechanism, and comparing its effectiveness in opposition to actual-world attacks.
The scope of our task encompasses the improvement of a program-primarily based answer that detects and stops keylogger activities in actual-time, making sure the confidentiality and integrity of touchy statistics.
